### Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">Morse code is a method used in telecommunication with the use of dot(.) and dash(-) as signals to represent characters. The International Morse Code encodes the basic Latin alphabet, some extra Latin letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals as standardised sequences of short and long signals "dots" (or "dits") and "dashes" (or "dahs"), the duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each character, comprising letters, numbers, and some punctuation, is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes. Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence of equal duration to a dot. The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots (one dash), and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission.

### Special characters 
<p style="text-align: justify;">Special characters are also known as special symbols or non-alphanumeric characters,they are symbols that are not letters,numerals or standard punctuation marks in a written language.Special characters are not limited to any specific alphabet or language and are often found in international character sets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each special character in Morse code has a unique sequence of dots and dashes that represents it.These sequences are standardized to ensure consistent communication. </p> 

Basic special characters morse code:  

| Character                | Code          | Character             | Code       |
|   :---:                  |     :---:     |     :---:             |   :---:    |
| Period[.]                |     .-.-.-    |   Colon[:]            |    ---...  |
| Comma[,]                 |    --..--     |   Semicolon[;]        |    -.-.-.  |
| Question mark [?]        |     ..--..    |     Double dash[=]    |    -...-   |
| Apostrophe[']            |     .----.    |    Plus[+]            |    .-.-.   |
| Exclamation mark[!]      |     -.-.--    |    Hyphen, Minus[-]   |    -....-  |
| Slash [/],Fraction bar   |     -..-.     |     Underscore[_]     |    ..--.-  |
| Parenthesis open[(]      |    -.--.      |    Quotation mark[“]  |    .-..-.  |
| Parenthesis close[)]     |    -.--.-     |    Dollar sign [$]    |    …-..-   |
| Ampersand [&],Wait       |     .-...     |    At sign[@]         |    .--.-.  |


<p style="text-align: justify;">These special characters are essential in Morse code communication, allowing for the transmission of a wide range of written language elements and additional notations.</p>
